### Introduction



This Implementation guide is experimental and not meant for publication at this time. It is a the result of my attempts at continuing the development of a Ophtalmology Implementation Guide published by the ['Eyes on FHIR' working groups STU 1 Ballot version](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/eyecare/2021Sep/index.html) 


If you are reading this and interested in improving interoperability in ophthalmology please do get in touch with me at fuhr.lars@gmail.com
